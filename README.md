# Legal disclaimer
I do not and have NEVER owned any of the programs/games that these scripts launch, nor do they include any code from said programs. The only parts of said programs/games that are included are their icons. There is 0 DRM circumvention code or anything of the sort. These tools are not designed to crack or illegally redistribute anything. You MUST download these tools from the official sources. Please also be aware that some of the appinfo.ini files may contain incorrect information like referring to a closed source program as open source... Most of these were made by copy/pasting an existing one. Though, you would never really need to bother with this
